  The dataset will be sent to my personal mail id within some time. After that, I will do the Analysis.

  The data has been sent to my mailID as mbox format. I downloaded zip file and extracted as the mbox format and uploded it in google drive for 
  loading it in collab.


### 2. Data Preprocessing done.
The data has been preprocessed by various steps by Data Transformation, Data loading, Handling NaN values, Data refactoring, and removing useless columns.
Data preprocessing is an important step in Data analysis or EDA as it makes the data prepared for the operation called Analysis or Exploration through it.
